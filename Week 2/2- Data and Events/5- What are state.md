# What are state ?

In React, state represents the internal data of a component that determines its current behavior. It's essentially the component's memory where it stores information that can change over time. State is crucial for controlling what is displayed in the browser from a component, and it plays a significant role in keeping components synchronized and ensuring that the app behaves as intended.

Let's break down the concept of state with a code example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// Stateless Component
function StatelessComponent() {
    return <p>This is a stateless component.</p>;
}

// Stateful Component
function StatefulComponent() {
    // Define a state variable called 'greet' and a function to update it, 'setGreet'
    const [greet, setGreet] = useState('Hello');

    // Function to handle state update
    const changeGreeting = () => {
        setGreet('Bonjour');
    };

    return (
        <div>
            <p>{greet}, World!</p>
            <button onClick={changeGreeting}>Change Greeting</button>
        </div>
    );
}

export default function App() {
    return (
        <div>
            <StatelessComponent />
            <StatefulComponent />
        </div>
    );
}
```

Explanation:

1. We import `useState` hook from React to enable state management within functional components.

2. We define a stateful component `StatefulComponent` where we use `useState` to declare a state variable `greet` with an initial value of `'Hello'`. We also get a function `setGreet` to update the state variable.

3. Inside `StatefulComponent`, we render a paragraph displaying the value of `greet` followed by 'World!'. We also render a button that, when clicked, calls `changeGreeting` function to update the value of `greet` to `'Bonjour'`.

4. We create a stateless component `StatelessComponent` which simply renders a static message.

5. Finally, in the `App` component, we render both the stateless and stateful components.

In summary, state in React allows components to manage their internal data, enabling them to dynamically update and re-render based on changes. Stateful components like `StatefulComponent` can hold and modify state, while stateless components like `StatelessComponent` don't have internal state and simply render based on the props they receive. This clear separation helps in organizing and maintaining React applications effectively.
