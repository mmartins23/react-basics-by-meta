# What is an asset and where does it live?

In React, assets refer to files such as images, style sheets, fonts, and media files that are needed by your app at runtime to provide a complete user experience. Assets are essential for enhancing the visual appeal and functionality of your React applications. Organizing assets efficiently is crucial to ensure that your components have access to them when needed.

### Summary of Asset Usage in React:

1. **Definition of Assets**: Assets encompass various files required by your React app, including images, style sheets, fonts, and media files.

2. **Organizational Best Practices**:
   - Create an `assets` folder inside the `src` directory to store all your app's assets.
   - Some assets, such as favicon and logo images, can be placed directly in the `public` folder. The general rule is that if your app can compile without an asset, it can be stored in the `public` folder.

3. **Importing Assets**:
   - To import an asset file into a component, use the `import` statement followed by the asset name and the `from` keyword, specifying the path to the asset file.
   - For example:
     ```jsx
     import cat from './assets/cat.jpg';
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can use the `require` keyword directly inside the JSX expression to reference the asset's path relative to the component. This method eliminates the need for an import statement.
   - Example using `require`:
     ```jsx
     <img src={require('./assets/cat.jpg')} alt="Cat" />
     ```

4. **Usage in Components**:
   - After importing or requiring the asset, you can use it in JSX elements by specifying the asset's name or path as the value of attributes like `src` for images.
   - Example usage:
     ```jsx
     function CatComponent() {
       return (
         <div>
           <img src={cat} alt="Cat" />
         </div>
       );
     }
     ```

By following these best practices and techniques for importing and using assets, you can effectively incorporate images, styles, and other resources into your React applications, enhancing their visual appeal and user experience.
